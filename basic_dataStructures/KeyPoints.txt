Key Points of the Basic Data Structure

• Every data structure has advantages and disadvantages. Knowing them is key to
writing performant software.

• Functions such as List.insert have characteristics that can cripple performance
when used haphazardly. If you find yourself needing to use insert frequently with
indices near the beginning of the list, you may want to consider a different data
structure, such as a linked list.

• Map sacrifices the ability to access elements by ordered index but has fast insertion
and retrieval.

• Set guarantees uniqueness in a collection of values. It’s optimized for speed, and
like Map, abandons the ability to access elements by ordered index.
