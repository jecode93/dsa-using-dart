Key Points
• Time complexity is a measure of the time required to run an algorithm as the
input size increases.
• You should know about constant time, logarithmic time, linear time, quadratic
time and quasilinear time and be able to order them by cost.
• Space complexity is a measure of the memory required for the algorithm to run.
• Big O notation is used to represent the general form of time and space
complexity.
• Time and space complexity are high-level measures of scalability; they do not
measure the actual speed of the algorithm itself.
• For small data sets, time complexity is usually irrelevant. A quasilinear algorithm
can be slower than a quadratic algorithm.
